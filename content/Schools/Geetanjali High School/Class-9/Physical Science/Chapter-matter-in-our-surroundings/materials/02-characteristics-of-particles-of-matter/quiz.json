    "options": [
      "The particles of the food are very small",
      "The particles of the food have high kinetic energy and diffuse rapidly",
      "The particles of the food are held together by a strong force",
      "The hot food has a low density"
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "rationale": "The particles of matter are continuously moving. As temperature increases, particles move faster (have higher kinetic energy), leading to faster diffusion."

    "options": [
      "Fusion",
      "Condensation",
      "Diffusion",
      "Evaporation"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "rationale": "The process of particles of matter intermixing on their own is called diffusion."

    "stem": "Why can a diver cut through water easily but a karate expert is needed to cut a solid block of wood?",
    "options": [
      "Matter is continuous",
      "The force of attraction is stronger in water",
      "Particles of water have more space and a weaker force of attraction between them",
      "Water has a lower density"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "rationale": "The ability to cut through water shows that the force of attraction between water particles is relatively weak. It is much stronger in a solid like wood."

    "question_id": "cpm4",
    "stem": "What happens to the kinetic energy of particles of matter when the temperature is increased?",
    "options": [
      "It decreases",
      "It remains the same",
      "It increases",
      "It becomes zero"
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "rationale": "As the temperature rises, particles move faster, which means their kinetic energy also increases."

    "options": [
      "They are stationary",
      "They are invisible",
      "They repel each other",
      "They are continuously moving"

    "answer_index": 3,
    "rationale": "Particles of matter are continuously moving and possess kinetic energy."

      "Force of attraction",
      "Magnetic force"

    "answer_index": 2,
    "rationale": "Particles of matter have a force acting between them that keeps them together. This is called the force of attraction."
