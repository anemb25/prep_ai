# Characteristics of Particles of Matter

Particles of matter have three main characteristics:

Particles of Matter Have Space Between Them

As seen in the salt/sugar dissolution activity (Activity 1.1), the particles of one substance can get into the empty spaces between the particles of another substance.

This is why liquids and solids can dissolve in liquids. For example, when you make tea, coffee, or lemonade, the particles of sugar and tea/coffee get into the spaces between the water particles.

This shows that there is a lot of empty space between the particles of matter.

Particles of Matter are Continuously Moving

Particles of matter are never at rest; they are always in constant motion. This is because they possess kinetic energy.

Evidence:

The smell of an unlit incense stick can only be detected when you are close, but when it is lit, the smell spreads across the room. The heat from the burning stick increases the kinetic energy of the particles, making them move faster and spread further.

When a drop of ink is put into water, it slowly and evenly spreads throughout the water without being stirred. This is due to the movement of both ink and water particles.

Diffusion: The intermixing of particles of two different types of matter on their own is called diffusion. This happens because of the constant movement of the particles. Diffusion becomes faster when the temperature is increased because the kinetic energy of the particles increases.

Particles of Matter Attract Each Other

There is a force of attraction between the particles of matter that holds them together.

Evidence:

Human Chain Analogy: If a group of people locks arms tightly, it is difficult to break their chain. If they just touch with fingertips, the chain is easy to break. This shows that the strength of the force varies.

Breaking Objects: It is very difficult to break an iron nail by hammering, while a piece of chalk can be easily broken. This is because the particles in the iron nail are held together by a much stronger force of attraction than in the chalk.

Cutting Water: You cannot easily cut the surface of water with your fingers because the water particles are held together by a force of attraction.

The strength of this force of attraction is different in different kinds of matter.
