# Physical Nature of Matter


What is Matter?

Everything in the universe is made up of a material that scientists call "matter".

Matter is anything that has mass (the amount of substance in an object) and occupies space (volume).

Examples: The air you breathe, the food you eat, clouds, stones, plants, and even a single drop of water are all matter.

Historical View: Early Indian philosophers believed matter was composed of five basic elements called the "Panch Tatva": air, earth, fire, sky, and water. This idea was also shared by ancient Greek philosophers.

Matter is Made Up of Particles

For a long time, there was a debate on whether matter was continuous (like a block of wood) or particulate (made up of small particles like sand).

Activity: When we dissolve salt or sugar in water, the level of the water does not rise. This is because the tiny particles of salt or sugar get into the spaces between the particles of water. This experiment proves that matter is not continuous; it is made of particles.

How Small are These Particles?

The particles of matter are extremely small, even beyond our imagination.

Activity: You can take a few crystals of potassium permanganate and keep diluting the solution with clear water multiple times. Even after diluting it 5 to 8 times, the water remains coloured.

Conclusion: This shows that just a few crystals contain millions of tiny particles that keep on dividing themselves into smaller and smaller particles. The same effect is seen when using Dettol, where the smell can be detected even after repeated dilution.
