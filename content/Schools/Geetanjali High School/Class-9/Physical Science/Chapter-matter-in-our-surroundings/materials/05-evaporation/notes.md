# Evaporation

What is Evaporation? üíß

Evaporation is the process where a liquid changes into a gas (or vapor)  at any temperature below its boiling point.

It's a surface phenomenon, meaning it happens only at the surface of the liquid.

Particles at the surface of a liquid have a small amount of extra kinetic energy. If they get enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction holding them to the other liquid particles, they can escape and become a gas.


Examples: Wet clothes drying, water left in an open dish disappearing over time.

Factors Affecting Evaporation üå°Ô∏èüí®

The rate of evaporation increases with:


An increase in surface area: Evaporation is a surface phenomenon, so spreading out a liquid (like spreading clothes on a line) increases the area where particles can escape, making it faster.


An increase in temperature: When you increase the temperature, more liquid particles get enough kinetic energy to turn into vapor, speeding up evaporation.


A decrease in humidity: Humidity is the amount of water vapor already in the air. If the air is already full of water vapor (high humidity), it can't hold much more, so evaporation slows down.


An increase in wind speed: When the wind blows, it carries away the water vapor particles from the liquid's surface, which creates a lower concentration of vapor in the surrounding air. This allows more liquid particles to escape, speeding up evaporation. This is why clothes dry faster on a windy day.

How Does Evaporation Cause Cooling? ‚ùÑÔ∏è

During evaporation, the high-energy particles escape from the surface of the liquid. The remaining liquid particles have lower average kinetic energy, which makes the liquid and its surroundings feel cooler.

To regain the energy they lost, the liquid particles absorb energy from their surroundings, which makes the surroundings feel cold.

Examples:

When you put acetone (nail polish remover) on your palm, the liquid particles gain energy from your hand and evaporate, making your palm feel cold.

People sprinkle water on a hot roof after a sunny day. The water evaporates, absorbing a large amount of heat from the roof, which cools it down.

We wear cotton clothes in summer because cotton absorbs sweat, which then evaporates from the surface, taking heat energy from our bodies and making us feel cool.
