      "It decreases.",
      "It remains the same.",
      "It becomes zero."

    "options": [
      "To increase the temperature of the clothes.",
      "To increase the surface area for faster evaporation.",
      "To decrease the wind speed.",
      "To prevent them from getting wrinkles."
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "rationale": "Evaporation is a surface phenomenon. By spreading out clothes, the surface area is increased, which increases the rate of evaporation."

    "stem": "What causes the cooling effect of evaporation?",
    "options": [
      "The release of heat energy by the liquid.",
      "The absorption of heat energy from the surroundings by the liquid's particles.",
      "The decrease in temperature of the liquid.",
      "The increase in humidity of the air."
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "rationale": "During evaporation, particles of the liquid absorb energy from the surroundings to regain the energy lost, which makes the surroundings feel cold."

    "options": [
      "To increase the humidity.",
      "To add moisture to the air.",
      "The large latent heat of vaporisation of water helps to cool the hot surface.",
      "To clean the roof."
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "rationale": "The large latent heat of vaporisation of water allows it to absorb a lot of heat from the hot surface as it evaporates, causing a cooling effect."
