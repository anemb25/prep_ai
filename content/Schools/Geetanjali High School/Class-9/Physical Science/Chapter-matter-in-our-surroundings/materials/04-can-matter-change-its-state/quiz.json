    "options": [
      "The heat is used up to increase the kinetic energy of particles.",
      "The heat is absorbed by the surrounding environment.",
      "The heat is used to overcome the forces of attraction between the particles.",
      "The substance cannot absorb more heat."

    "answer_index": 2,
    "rationale": "The heat supplied during melting is used up to overcome the forces of attraction between particles, so the temperature does not rise."
