# Can Matter Change its State?

Yes, matter can change its state from solid to liquid to gas and back by changing its temperature and/or pressure.

Effect of Change of Temperature
Solid to Liquid (Melting/Fusion):

When a solid is heated, its particles gain kinetic energy and start vibrating faster.

The heat energy overcomes the strong forces of attraction between the particles, and they leave their fixed positions to move more freely.

The solid then melts and becomes a liquid.

Melting Point: The minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at atmospheric pressure is called its melting point. The melting point of ice is 273.15 K (or $0^{\circ}$C). The process is also called fusion.

Latent Heat of Fusion: During melting, the temperature of the substance remains constant even though heat is continuously supplied. This heat energy is used to change the state by overcoming the forces of attraction between the particles. This "hidden" heat is called the latent heat of fusion. It is the amount of heat required to change 1 kg of a solid to a liquid at its melting point and atmospheric pressure. This is why water at $0^{\circ}$C has more energy than ice at the same temperature.

Liquid to Gas (Boiling/Vaporisation):

When a liquid is heated, its particles move even faster.

At a specific temperature, the particles gain enough energy to completely break free from the forces of attraction and change into the gaseous state.

Boiling Point: The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at atmospheric pressure is called its boiling point. The boiling point of water is 373 K (or $100^{\circ}$C).

Latent Heat of Vaporisation: Similar to fusion, the temperature remains constant during boiling. The extra heat energy is absorbed by the particles to change from a liquid to a gas. This "hidden" heat is the latent heat of vaporisation. This is why steam at $100^{\circ}$C causes more severe burns than boiling water at the same temperature because the steam particles have absorbed this extra energy.

Solid to Gas (Sublimation):

Some substances can change directly from the solid state to the gaseous state without becoming a liquid. This process is called sublimation.

Example: Camphor and naphthalene balls. The solid particles gain enough energy to directly enter the gaseous state. The reverse process (gas to solid) is called deposition.

Effect of Change of Pressure
By applying pressure and reducing temperature, gases can be liquefied. When pressure is applied, the particles of a gas are forced closer together, eventually forming a liquid.

Example: Dry Ice

Solid carbon dioxide (CO 
2

 ) is stored under high pressure.

When the pressure is decreased to 1 atmosphere, it converts directly into a gas without changing into a liquid state. This is why it is called "dry ice".
