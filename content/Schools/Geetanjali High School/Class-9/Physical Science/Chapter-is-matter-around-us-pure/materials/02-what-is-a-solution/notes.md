What is a Solution?

A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances.

Solutions are made of a solute and a solvent.

The solvent is the component that dissolves the other component and is usually present in a larger amount.

The solute is the component that is dissolved in the solvent and is usually present in a lesser quantity.

Examples of Solutions:

Solid in a liquid: A solution of sugar in water. Sugar is the solute, and water is the solvent.

Gas in a liquid: Aerated drinks like soda water. Carbon dioxide gas is the solute, and water is the solvent.

Gas in a gas: Air. It's a homogeneous mixture of gases, mainly nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%).

Properties of a Solution:

It is a homogeneous mixture.

Its particles are smaller than 1 nm in diameter and cannot be seen with the naked eye.

The particles do not scatter a beam of light, so the path of light is not visible through a solution.     * The solute particles cannot be separated by filtration and do not settle down when left undisturbed, making the solution stable.

Concentration of a Solution:

The concentration is the amount of solute in a given amount of solution.

A saturated solution has dissolved as much solute as it is capable of dissolving at a given temperature.

An unsaturated solution has an amount of solute less than the saturation level.
