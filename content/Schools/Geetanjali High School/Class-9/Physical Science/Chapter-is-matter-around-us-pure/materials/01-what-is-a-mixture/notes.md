What is a Mixture?

A pure substance is a single form of matter where all its constituent particles are the same in their chemical nature. For a scientist, milk, ghee, and salt from the market are not pure because they are mixtures.


A mixture is a substance that contains more than one pure substance mixed in any proportion. For example, a soft drink is a mixture of sugar, water, and carbon dioxide.



Types of Mixtures:


Homogeneous Mixtures: These have a uniform composition throughout. Examples include sugar dissolved in water and salt dissolved in water. Homogeneous mixtures can have a variable composition, meaning you can add more or less of a substance to it.




Heterogeneous Mixtures: These have physically distinct parts and a non-uniform composition. Examples include mixtures of sodium chloride and iron filings, or oil and water.
