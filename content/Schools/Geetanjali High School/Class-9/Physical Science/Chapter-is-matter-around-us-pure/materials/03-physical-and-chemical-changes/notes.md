# Physical and Chemical Changes

Physical Change: A change that alters the physical properties (like color, hardness, or density) but not the chemical composition of a substance. The substance remains chemically the same. For example, water, ice, and water vapor are all chemically the same substance (H_2O).


Chemical Change: A change that results in a change in the chemical properties of a substance, forming a new substance. A chemical change is also called a 

chemical reaction. For example, burning is a chemical change because a substance reacts with another to change its chemical composition. The rusting of iron is also a chemical change.
