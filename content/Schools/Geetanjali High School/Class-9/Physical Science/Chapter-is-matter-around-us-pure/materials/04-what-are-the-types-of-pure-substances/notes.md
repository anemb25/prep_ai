# What are the Types of Pure Substances?

Based on their chemical composition, pure substances are classified as either 

elements or compounds.


Elements: An element is a basic form of matter that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical reactions.

Elements are classified as 

metals, non-metals, and metalloids.

Metals are lustrous, malleable, ductile, sonorous, and good conductors of heat and electricity. Examples: gold, silver, iron.

Non-metals are poor conductors and are not lustrous, sonorous, or malleable. Examples: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon.

Metalloids have properties intermediate between metals and non-metals. Examples: boron, silicon, and germanium.


Compounds: A compound is a substance made of two or more elements that are chemically combined in a fixed proportion.


A key difference from a mixture is that a compound's properties are 

totally different from its constituent elements. For example, iron and sulfur can be mixed physically (a mixture), but when they are heated and chemically combined, they form a compound with completely different properties.





The components of a compound can only be separated by 

chemical or electrochemical reactions, not by simple physical methods.
