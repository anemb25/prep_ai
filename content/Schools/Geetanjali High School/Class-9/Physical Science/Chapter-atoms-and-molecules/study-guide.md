# How to study: Atoms and Molecules

1. Read for the Big Picture First: Before you dive into the details, read the entire chapter quickly to get a sense of the main ideas. What is an atom? What is a molecule? How do they combine? This will give you a mental map of the chapter.

2. Master the Definitions: This chapter is filled with important definitions. Don't just memorize them; understand what they mean. Create a list of key terms and their definitions, like Law of Conservation of Mass, Law of Constant Proportions, Atom, Molecule, Ion, Atomic Mass Unit, and Valency.

3. Pay Attention to the Laws: The laws of chemical combination (Law of Conservation of Mass and Law of Constant Proportions) are the foundation of this chapter. Make sure you understand what each law states and how John Dalton's theory explains them. You can use the examples in the book (like the water ratio of 1:8) to help you remember the Law of Constant Proportions.

4. Practice Writing Symbols and Formulas: The section on writing chemical formulas is very practical. The best way to learn it is to practice. Don't just read the examples; try to write the formulas yourself without looking at the book first. Use the criss-cross method shown in the PDF to get the valencies correct. 

5.  Calculate Molecular and Formula Unit Mass: The last section requires calculation. You need to know the atomic masses of common elements. Practice the examples provided in the book, and then try to calculate the mass of other compounds. This will solidify your understanding.
