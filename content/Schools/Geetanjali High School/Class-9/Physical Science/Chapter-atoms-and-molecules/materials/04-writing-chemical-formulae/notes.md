# Writing Chemical Formulae

Definition: A chemical formula is a symbolic representation of a compound's composition. It shows the elements in the compound and the number of atoms of each element.



Valency: The valency is the combining power or capacity of an element. It can be thought of as the "arms" of an atom that link to other atoms.


Rules for Writing Formulas:

The valencies or charges on the ions must balance to make the compound neutral.


When a compound has a metal and a non-metal, the metal's symbol is written first.

For polyatomic ions, if there are two or more of them, you must put the ion's formula in a bracket and write the number outside as a subscript. If there is only one, no bracket is needed (e.g., NaOH).




The Criss-Cross Method:

Write the symbols of the elements.

Write their valencies below them.

Cross over the valencies to form the formula.

Example: Hydrogen Sulphide (H_2S)

Symbols: H, S

Valencies: 1, 2

Crossover gives 

H_2S.
