# What is a Molecule?

Definition: A molecule is a group of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together. It is the smallest particle of an element or a compound that is capable of independent existence and shows all the properties of that substance.



Molecules of Elements: These are made up of the same type of atoms.

Some elements, like argon (Ar) and helium (He), are made of only one atom. They are called 

monoatomic.



Others, like oxygen, are made of two atoms (

O_2) and are called diatomic.


The number of atoms in a molecule is known as its 

atomicity.


Molecules of Compounds: These are formed when atoms of different elements join together in definite proportions.

Examples include water (

H_2O), ammonia (NH_3), and carbon dioxide (CO_2).

What is an Ion?

Compounds made of metals and non-metals contain charged particles called 

ions.

Ions can be a single charged atom or a group of atoms with a net charge.

A negatively charged ion is an 

anion, and a positively charged ion is a cation.

A group of atoms carrying a charge is called a 

polyatomic ion (e.g., SO_4 
2âˆ’
  which is sulfate)
