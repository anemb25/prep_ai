# Laws of Chemical Combination

Ancient Ideas: Long ago, philosophers in India and Greece thought about matter being divisible. An Indian philosopher, 

Maharishi Kanad, named the smallest, indivisible particles Parmanu. Around the same time, Greek philosophers like 

Democritus called these particles atoms (meaning indivisible).


The Rise of Modern Chemistry: By the 18th century, scientists began to use experiments to understand how and why elements combine. This led to two important laws established by 

Antoine L. Lavoisier and Joseph L. Proust.


Law of Conservation of Mass: This law states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. This means the total mass of the substances you start with (reactants) is always equal to the total mass of the substances you end up with (products).

For example, in a reaction where 5.3 g of sodium carbonate reacts with 6 g of acetic acid, the total mass of the reactants is 11.3 g. The products are 2.2 g of carbon dioxide, 0.9 g of water, and 8.2 g of sodium acetate, which also adds up to 11.3 g.


Law of Constant Proportions (or Definite Proportions): This law states that in a pure chemical compound, the elements are always present in definite proportions by mass, regardless of where the compound comes from or how it was prepared.

For example, in water (

H_2O), the ratio of the mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is always 1:8. If you decompose 9 g of water, you will always get 1 g of hydrogen and 8 g of oxygen.
