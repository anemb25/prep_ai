# What is an Atom?

The Building Block: Just as a building is made of bricks and an anthill is made of grains of sand, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.


Size of Atoms: Atoms are extremely small; you cannot see them with your naked eye. Even stacking millions of atoms would only create a layer as thin as a sheet of paper. The size of an atom is measured in 



nanometers (10 
âˆ’9
  m).

Symbols of Elements:


John Dalton was the first to propose specific symbols for elements.

Today, we use symbols approved by the 

International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).

Symbols are usually one or two letters from the element's English name. The first letter is always a capital, and the second is a small letter (e.g., Al for Aluminium, Co for Cobalt).



Some symbols come from Latin, German, or Greek names (e.g., Fe for iron from 

ferrum, Na for sodium from natrium, K for potassium from kalium).

Atomic Mass:

Dalton's theory introduced the concept of 

atomic mass.

It was difficult to find the mass of an individual atom, so scientists started with a relative atomic mass. Initially, they used 1/16th the mass of an oxygen atom as the unit.

In 1961, 

carbon-12 isotope was chosen as the standard reference for measuring atomic masses.

One 

atomic mass unit (u) is defined as exactly one-twelfth (1/12 
th
 ) the mass of one atom of carbon-12.


How Atoms Exist: Most atoms cannot exist on their own. They combine with other atoms to form 

molecules and ions. These molecules or ions then come together in large numbers to form the matter we see and touch.
