# Molecular Mass

Molecular Mass: This is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule. It is expressed in atomic mass units (u).


Example: Water (H_2O)

Atomic mass of H = 1 u

Atomic mass of O = 16 u

Molecular Mass = 

(2×1)+(1×16)=18 u.


Formula Unit Mass: This is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a formula unit of a compound. We use this term for substances whose constituent particles are ions. It is calculated in the same way as molecular mass.



Example: Sodium Chloride (NaCl)

Atomic mass of Na = 23 u

Atomic mass of Cl = 35.5 u

Formula Unit Mass = 

(1×23)+(1×35.5)=58.5 u.
